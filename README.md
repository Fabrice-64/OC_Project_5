# OC_Project_5
Set up a DB linked to Open Food Facts.
## Purpose of this project
This project aims at helping a user to collect pieces of information from Open Food Facts DataBase.
The core functionalities can be described as follows:
* Get a part of Open Food Facts DB available offline;
* Get access to a console where the user can ask for an item 
* Then 2 possibilities:
1.  The item is in the DB:
  * it sends back the data available on this very item
  * and a link to OFF DB towards the current data of this item
2.  The item is NOT in the DB:
  it sends back an invitation for a new request
