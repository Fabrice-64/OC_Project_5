# OC_Project_5

## Context
The purpose of this project is to set up a DB linked to Open Food Facts within the framework of an OpenClassrooms education program on Python.

**Notice: This Application is conceived as a stand-alone. Therefore it does not encompass the required protection measures, like protection of the DB against injections, etc**

**Notice: a dedicated script, embedded in the application, guides the user along the creation of a local DB in order to be able to use it. However, the prerequisite remains that he has installed mySQL.**
